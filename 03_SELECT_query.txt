qs8: Count how many employees are in the table..


2 Solutions
SELECT count(*) FROM Employees;
SELECT count(emp_id) FROM Employees;

Which is better? count(*) will always give us the total count of the table regardless of presence or absence of NULL values in the table 

count(anycolumn) may give us all values, may not. If it is a primary key, then its as good as count(*), because primary key column will contain no NULL value. But other columns can contain NULL values and count(othercolumn) will only count rows where values exist (skipping the null entries)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Qs9: Count how many employees are in each department.

SELECT department, count(*) FROM Employees 
GROUP BY Department 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Qs10: Get average salary for each department.
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM Employees 
GROUP BY department 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

qs11: Get departments having more than 1 employee.
SELECT department FROM Employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1   #Used whenever we want to impose condition on a group column

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qs12: Get the maximum salary from employees.
SELECT MAX(*) FROM Employee

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qs13: Get the distinct departments from employees.
SELECT department DISTINCT FROM Employees  (WRONG XXXX)
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM Employees (RIGHT) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qs14: Get highest paid employees.
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees
)


(Remember we cant do this: WHERE salary = MAX(SALARY)), aggregates cant be used directly with a conditional, we instead use nested queries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qs15: Get the top 2 highest paid employees 
SELECT * FROM Employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 2

#If we want a specific number of employees, we use LIMIT clause 
We ordered all the rows in terms of Salary descending wise, then we used LIMIT to retrieve the top 2 elements 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qs16: Join employees with departments table to get department name.

SELECT e.name, d.name
FROM Employees e 
JOIN Departments d ON e.emp_id = d.emp_id


If we use just JOIN, then its most likely INNER JOIN 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qs17: Get names of employees whose salary is above average salary.

SELECT name FROM Employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees 
);
