qs8: Count how many employees are in the table..


2 Solutions
SELECT count(*) FROM Employees;
SELECT count(emp_id) FROM Employees;

Which is better? count(*) will always give us the total count of the table regardless of presence or absence of NULL values in the table 

count(anycolumn) may give us all values, may not. If it is a primary key, then its as good as count(*), because primary key column will contain no NULL value. But other columns can contain NULL values and count(othercolumn) will only count rows where values exist (skipping the null entries)
